## CheckboxWithLabel

Take a look at `src/CheckboxWithLabel.js`.

This component is a checkbox that can be checked on and off. When it is
checked, it's label should read "on", and when it is unchecked it should read
"off". These label values are passed as props in `src/App.js`.

## HoverLink

Take a look at `src/HoverLink.js`.

This component is just a basic link component. It should have a class of
either `'normal'` or `'hover'` depending on if a user is hovering over it.

The `src/css/index.scss` file should have some styles for both classes.
